## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

My starting point was to get the content on here with HTML. 
I used CSS to incorporate some styling and noticed it started to look like the old azlyrics site from back in the day but more saturated in color. 

## Optimizations

None as of yet

## Lessons Learned:
- There are a list of generic CSS Fonts to use [https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_font.asp]

- There is a list that exist of CSS Web Safe Fonts [https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp] meaning fonts used on every computer/device always fallback with a generic font
